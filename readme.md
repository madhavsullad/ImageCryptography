# ImageCryptography
An opensource project to send and receive images encrypted using RSA algorithm. Developed using C# and Python in Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 preview. For this application to work we need to place these four python scripts in the `\ImageCryptography\bin\Debug` directory created by the IDE or in the same directory as that of the compiled `.exe` file.
